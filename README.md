# Sergio's Runtipi appstore

This is my small personal appstore for Runtipi.

## Apps

Here are the apps I have so far:
- [Maybe](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe) - A personal finance manager
- [Mafl](https://github.com/hywax/mafl) - An intuitive service for organizing your homepage

## Installation

Using the appstore is simple.

1. In the Runtipi dashboard, open settings and go to the "App Stores" tab.
2. Click "Add App Store" and fill in the form with a nice name and the URL `https://github.com/sergi0g/runtipi-appstore`.
3. Submit the form. You can now go to the App Store and select the one you just created from the dropdown.
4. Choose an app and install it. Have fun!

> [!WARNING]
> If you use this appstore, please keep in mind that it is a hobby project and I have very limited spare time for it. I'll try my best to keep apps up to date and in a working configuration, but I can make no guarantees. I will not be constantly responding to user support requests. I may also delete an app at any time.
