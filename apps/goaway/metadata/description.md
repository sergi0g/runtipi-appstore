## Goaway

Goaway is a lightweight DNS sinkhole for blocking unwanted domains at the network level. Block ads, trackers, and malicious domains before they reach your devices.

### Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

The default username is `admin`. A password is generated on first startup and is shown in the logs. I recommend changing it after logging in for the first time.

‚ö†Ô∏è The default DNS server is Quad9. I chose it as a slightly better option than the defaults of Google's `8.8.8.8` or Cloudflare's `1.1.1.1`. If you're concerned about privacy, I recommend changing it to a DNS server you trust, or self hosting your own (I'd suggest [SDNS](https://github.com/semihalev/sdns) for that and might add it to the app store).
