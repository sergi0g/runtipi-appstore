# Nextcloud Micro ‚òÅ

**A safe home for all your data.**

Nextcloud Micro is a very small Nextcloud installation (compared to others, at least).
Here's what you miss out on:
- Automatic cron jobs
- Redis
- Postgres (replaced by sqlite)

I'd only recommend using this if you want to run a minimal server for very few people and don't plan on receiving much traffic. Otherwise, you should probably take a look at the other Nextcloud apps in the official appstore.
